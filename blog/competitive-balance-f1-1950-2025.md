How Competitive Has Formula 1 Really Been? A Data Look at 1950–2025

Formula 1 is often described as a sport dominated by a few powerful teams. Fans
frequently debate whether modern Formula 1 has become less competitive and more
predictable than in the past. Instead of relying on opinions, this project looks
at the data to understand how competitive Formula 1 has actually been over the
last 70+ years.

This analysis uses historical race data from 1950 to 2025 to examine two main
questions:

How concentrated have race wins been among constructors?

Has qualifying position become more important over time?

The Data

The analysis uses publicly available Formula 1 race results covering every
season from 1950 to 2025. The dataset includes information such as season year,
constructor, qualifying position, and race finishing position.

To keep results consistent across the full time period, the analysis focuses on
season-level patterns rather than individual race events. Non-classified race
results and missing qualifying positions are excluded to reduce noise.

Constructor Dominance Over Time

One way to measure competitiveness is to look at how many races are won by the
most successful team in each season. If one constructor wins most of the races,
competitive balance is lower. If wins are spread across many teams, competition
is higher.

The results show that Formula 1 has experienced periods of strong dominance
throughout its history. While some seasons are relatively balanced, others are
clearly dominated by a single constructor. Importantly, this pattern is not
limited to recent years—dominance appears in early decades as well as in modern
eras.

Looking at the number of constructors that win at least one race in a season
provides a similar picture. Some seasons feature many race-winning teams, while
others have only a few. Together, these results suggest that Formula 1 regularly
moves through cycles of dominance and competitive diversity.

Has Qualifying Become More Important?

Another common concern in Formula 1 is that qualifying has become too important.
If drivers tend to finish races close to where they start, overtaking becomes
more difficult and race outcomes become more predictable.

To explore this, the analysis measures the relationship between qualifying
position and race finishing position over time. The results show a clear long-term
trend: qualifying position has become a stronger predictor of race outcomes in
recent decades.

In earlier years, race results were less closely tied to starting positions.
Over time, this relationship has strengthened, indicating that track position
plays a larger role in determining race results today.

What Does This Mean?

Taken together, the results provide data-driven context for ongoing debates about
Formula 1 competition. Periods of dominance are not new, but modern seasons tend
to show higher race outcome predictability based on qualifying performance.

This does not mean that races are always less exciting or that overtaking never
happens. Instead, it highlights a structural shift in how race results are
determined, with qualifying performance playing a more important role than in the
past.

Limitations

This analysis is descriptive and does not attempt to explain why these trends
exist. It does not directly measure overtaking frequency, driver skill, or race
quality, and it does not include lap-level data or strategy effects. Future work
could build on this by using more detailed datasets.

Closing Thoughts

Long-term data provides valuable perspective in discussions about Formula 1
competition. By looking at more than seven decades of race results, this project
shows that dominance and predictability are recurring features of the sport, not
unique to any single era.
